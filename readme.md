Self-Encryption/Proxy Re-encryption

This is an implementation of the SE-PRE scheme of
"Sharing of Encrypted files in Blockchain Made Simpler" (https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/418.pdf),
compatible with the implementation in `https://github.com/0chain/gosdk`

> Proxy reâ€“encryption schemes are cryptosystems which allow third parties (proxies) to alter a ciphertext which has been encrypted for one party, so that it may be decrypted by another.
